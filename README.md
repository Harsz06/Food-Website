Food Website Project
I created a Food Website project using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework, designed to showcase a modern, responsive platform for food-related services. This project includes:

A visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Fully responsive layouts for seamless viewing across all devices.
Bootstrap features like grids, buttons, carousels, and modals for enhanced functionality.
Sections highlighting menu items, testimonials, and contact information.
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Bootstrap, particularly in creating responsive designs and leveraging its prebuilt components to speed up development.

As a student exploring web development, I continue to enhance my skills by learning new tools, frameworks, and techniques to create more interactive and dynamic web applications. This food website project is a step forward in my journey to becoming a proficient front-end developer.
